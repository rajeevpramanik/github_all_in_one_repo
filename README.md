**[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)** *is a generic open source automation framework. It can be used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).*

***Robot Framework** has easy syntax, utilizing human-readable keywords. Its capabilities can be extended by libraries implemented with Python or Java. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it, consisting of [libraries](https://robotframework.org/#libraries) and [tools](https://robotframework.org/#tools) that are developed as separate projects.*

*Robot Framework project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework) where you can find further documentation, source code, and issue tracker. Downloads are hosted at [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework).*

==============================================================

**[HTTP RequestsLibrary (Python)](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-requests#readme)** is a Robot Framework library aimed to provide HTTP api testing functionalities by wrapping the well known Python Requests Library.

==============================================================

**[Qweb](https://github.com/qentinelqi/qweb)** is an open source web automation interface in [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/). It makes automation  **rapid, robust, and fun**.

Qweb is a modern web testing library focusing on making web testing and automation Easy ðŸŽ‰ and maintainable ðŸ§¹ with its high level keyword design.

QWeb aims to make web automation easy and maintainable by:

* providing high level keywords for accessing any web page element
* preferring text locators (UI texts) but supporting also other locator strategies (xpaths, css selectors)
* automatically handling latencies etc. via automatic wait times
* automatically handling unexpected alerts
* minimizing the maintenance effort.
* Playing around with image & verifying the images.
* Pdf data verification.

See [examples](https://github.com/qentinelqi/qweb#examples).

[**AppiumLibrary**](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) Library for Android and iOS testing. It uses Appium internally.

==============================================================

[**DataDriver Library**](https://github.com/Snooz82/robotframework-datadriver) Library for Data-Driven Testing with external ðŸ“¤ data tables (csv, xls, xlsx, etc.). ðŸ§¬ Pairwise Combinatorial Testing support.

==============================================================

**[ExcellentLibrary](https://bartkl.github.io/robotframework-excellentlibrary/documentation/ExcellentLibrary.html)** This library is built on top of *OpenPyXL* in order to bring its functionality to  *Robot Framework* . The major motivation for this was to add support for *Excel 2010* (XSLX) files, which *ExcelLibrary* does not support.

==============================================================

**[Pabot](https://pabot.org/)** a parallel executor for [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) tests. Split one execution into multiple and save test execution time.
